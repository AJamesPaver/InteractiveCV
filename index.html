          <p>Oct 2022 - Present</p>
          <p>2022 was the time for me to apply my skills learned in Formula 1 to the decarbonisation and EV industry.</p>
          <p>I made the move to Williams Advanced Engineering which became Fortescue Zero and have been helping them 
            with the ambitious task of becoming a world leader in zero emission power systems for heavy industry.
          </p>
          <p>Here I developed new simulation types from the ground up for the new types of projects the company was undertaking.
            As well as leading the development of an entirely new simulation application and data analysis platform for the company.

          <p>Jan 2022 - Oct 2022</p>
          <p>I wanted to challenge myself with a new project and a new team.</p>
          <p>Being a Senior Engineer in the Aerodynamic Performance Team meant I could bring what knowledge and skills I had 
            developed to a different but familiar company.</p>
          <p>Along with supporting the race events, I aided the team in the development of their data analysis platform,
            incorporating vehicle dynamics simulation directly into the analysis environment and laid the groundwork for a live data system.</p>

          <p>"Sim Dev" is the most scientific and mathematically intensive part of any Formula 1 Team
