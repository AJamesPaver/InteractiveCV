            <p>Decisions are what lead us to succeed or fail. In Formula 1, the right decision, made at the right time,
                can win a race. Conversely, a poor decision, or one which takes too long to make, can cause the chance of
                success to slip away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fade-in">
            <p>Everything in Formula 1 can be thought of as a series of decisions, one made after another. From design,
                to development in aerodynamics, to testing and prove-out in the simulator and at the race track; every good
                decision made can give us the advantage.</p>

                <p>Which setup direction is best? Should we go higher on rear ride height or lower? Stiffer or softer?
                    Did this new aero upgrade perform as expected? Shall we carry this forward to the next session? What about
                    the tyres, are we warming the tyres correctly? How do we compare to our competitors?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fade-in">
                <p>All of these questions need to be answered - and quickly! It is not acceptable
                    to wait for a simulation to be run after the car has been in the garage for a number of minutes, that is precious
                    decision-making time lost. Instead, we hook our simulations directly into the telemetry of the car and run them
                    in real-time. This delivers the insight that the engineers need, enabling a decision to be made as the car is on
                    track!</p>

                <p>A huge number of people are involved in descision making in a Formula 1 team. Formula 1 is often thought of
                    as a purely scientific exercise, as though the decisions that must be made are somehow preordained. In 
                    reality, Formula 1 is a very human endeavour - it is the people that must understand and act upon the problem.</p>

                <p>This is where the industry buzzword "insight" comes in. The right data, delivered in the right way to the engineer,
                    can initiate an understanding which will lead to a winning decision.
